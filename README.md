# Educational resources

This is my place for storing all the videos, lessons, books and everything in between that contributes to the knowledge of software development and related skills.

Each new entry should be given a checkbox and after its completion I should write a few key takeaways for a later reference.

### React
- [ ] [Practical Redux - Mark Erikson](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2016/10/practical-redux-part-0-introduction/)
- [ ] [Profiling React Performance](https://addyosmani.com/blog/profiling-react-js/)
    - programmatic profiling of React apps with React Profiler API

### Functional programming
- [ ] [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm? – Richard Feldman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4)

### Creative Front-end
- [x] [Behind the scenes of We Cargo](https://medium.com/epicagency/behind-the-scenes-of-we-cargo-3999f5f559c)
  - WebGL and DOM can be combined by an abstraction layer
  - WebGL can sometimes be implemented as progressive enhancement, rendered underneath the dom elements

### Time management
- [x] [Why We're Bad at Estimating Time](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-estimate-time/) 
  - we often underestimate how long will a task take and there is phsychological reasoning behind that (optimism bias)
  - overcoming the planning fallacy: 
    - Use Historical Data (time tracking)
    - Have Someone Else Estimate for You (we estimate more realistically for others)
    - Estimate in Ranges, or Build in Time for Delays ([cone of uncertanty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12981417/68505059-af593400-0266-11ea-8997-703625a60b66.png))
    - Use Three-Point Estimations
    - Calculate Your Fudge Ratio (the percentage by which you always underestimate)
    - Estimate During the Low Point of Your Day (pessimistic approach, usually after lunch)
    
    
### Architecture and design
